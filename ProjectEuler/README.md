## Weloome
Here I host code for ProjectEuler, from brute force to step-by-step optimizations, sometimes taking inspirations from peers elsetime brainstorming on previous lessons.

## Directory Structure
- Each sub-directory represents a problem on ProjectEuler.
- The code are sorted in order of time written.
- The optimized code might be highly influenced from other sources.
